# OpenHouse.AI Front End Test
 This package represents my submission for the OpenHouse.AI Front End Test. Note I've only tested this project on my local machine via Brackets (http://brackets.io/). As I haven't used RESTful APIs before, I've used a tutorial to learn how to access data endpoints and then used the tutorial as a base for my submission. Credit for the tutorial is provided in index.html.
